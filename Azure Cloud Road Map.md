## Power BI and Azure cloud

1. Power BI with Azure SQL Database (Direct Query / Import Mode)
   Best for: Analyzing structured transactional data from Azure SQL Database.

   Approach 1: Direct Query
   1. Power BI connects directly to Azure SQL Database.
   2. Real-time data updates.
   3. No need to import data into Power BI.

   Approach 2: Import Mode
   1. Data is imported from Azure SQL into Power BI.
   2. Faster performance as data is cached.
   3. Refresh required for updates.
